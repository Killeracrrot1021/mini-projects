Hello!

Welcome to my little Github repo! This has some mini projects that I have made in it. Feel free to add projects (send a pull request) and I might put it in (if I see and like it). If you would like to add a project make sure to add some info on what it does here in the README.md file. Thanks to all that make contributions.

Another nice thing to do: <br/>
I have no skills when it comes to markdown (just look at the source text for this file). Could someone please help me fix this markdown file. Thank you!
